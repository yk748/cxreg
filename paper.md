# Summary

*Pathwise coordinate descent* (Friedman et al. 2007) is a popular
iterative optimization method for solving penalized linear regression
\[*lasso*; Tibshirani (1996)\] and penalized Gaussian log-likelihood
\[*graphical lasso*; e.g., Banerjee, El Ghaoui, and d’Aspremont (2008)\]
problems. Given a specified or derived sequence of tuning parameters
$\lambda$ in the penalty term, the algorithm updates one coordinate at a
time by isolating the target variable using partial residuals.

The coordinate descent algorithm for complex-valued lasso and Gaussian
graphical lasso, along with the corresponding \`cxreg’ R package,
leverages the standard pathwise coordinate descent method by
demonstrating its applicability to complex-valued settings (Deb,
Kuceyeski, and Basu 2024). Our algorithm is defined on the realifying
complex numbers via a ring isomorphism (e.g., Herstein 1991).
Specifically, for a complex number $z\in\mathbb{C}$, we define the map:

$$
\varphi(z) =
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbf{Re}(z) & -\mathbf{Im}(z) \\
\mathbf{Im}(z) &  \mathbf{Re}(z)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$ We show that the $\varphi$ is a field isomorphism between
$\mathbb{C}$ and the set

$$
\mathcal{M}^{2 \times 2} :=\biggl\{\begin{pmatrix} 
a & - b \\ b & a
\end{pmatrix} : a,b\in\mathbb{R}\biggr\}.
$$

Under this mapping, there exists connections between algebraic
operations in the real and complex domains. We extend these operations
to the $p$-dimensional case for $p>1$. Further details are provided in
Section 3.1 of Deb, Kuceyeski, and Basu (2024).

We use this mapping to transform linear regression problems in the
complex-valued setting into equivalent problems in the real-valued
setting. The same mapping can then be applied to the Gaussian
log-likelihood for complex-valued variables. For the $\ell_{1}$ penalty
term used in lasso and graphical lasso, we exploit the fact that the
modulus of each complex-valued coordinate is equivalent to the entrywise
$\ell_{2}$ norm of its real and imaginary parts. This implies that the
lasso formulation for $p$-dimensional complex-valued variables is
equivalent to a $2p$-dimensional group lasso (Yuan and Lin 2006), where
each group consists of the real and imaginary components of a single
complex variable ($p$ groups in total).

Finally, we implement the computational shortcuts, including *warm
start* with the solutions for the sequence of the tuning parameter
$\lambda$ in lasso and graphical lasso, and *active set selection* to
reduce the number of predictors that need to be updated at each
$\lambda$ (e.g., Chapter 5.4 in Hastie, Tibshirani, and Wainwright
2015). In the R package, the user interface, such as the names of inputs
for functions, is borrowed from the well-known pathwise coordinate
descent R package \`glmnet’ (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2010). A
detailed vignette is available
[Here](https://github.com/yk748/cxreg/blob/main/doc/cxreg.pdf).

# Statement of need

Solving complex-valued penalized Gaussian likelihood (as well as
penalized linear regression as a part of the problem) is critical in
high-dimensional time series analysis, as examining partial spectral
coherence in the frequency domain is analogous to examining partial
correlations in Gaussian graphical models (e.g., Priestley 1988). With
the development of the local Whittle likelihood approximation (Whittle
1951), the computation of the inverse spectral density matrix, called
the *spectral precision matrix*, enables the investigation of
associations among variables in high-dimensional time series data.

These associations, captured by the spectral precision matrix, are
evaluated at fixed frequencies. However, due to the inconsistency of the
spectral density matrix estimator at a single frequency (e.g., Chapter
10 in Brockwell and Davis 1991), it is necessary to compute an averaged
smoothed periodogram, obtained by aggregating periodogram matrices
across neighboring frequencies, as the sample analog of the spectral
density matrix. As a consequence, spectral precision matrices must be
computed at multiple neighboring frequencies around each fixed frequency
of interest. This is important in statistical inference of
high-dimensional spectral precision matrix (Krampe and Paparoditis
2025), requiring repetitive computations over high-dimensional objects.
In this context, the development of efficient optimization algorithms
for solving complex-valued penalized Gaussian likelihood is essential.

# State of the field

Although coordinate descent is known to be computationally efficient and
has been widely used to solve the lasso (Friedman et al. 2007) and
graphical Lasso (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2008), particularly
under sparsity assumptions, it has not been extended to complex-valued
settings. This limitation arises primarily because updating
complex-valued partial residuals within the coordinate descent framework
had not been explored.

The most well-known approach to this problem is based on the algorithm
proposed in Fiecas et al. (2019), which leverages *clime* (Cai, Liu, and
Luo 2011), formulated via linear programming. An alternative is the use
of the alternating direction method of multipliers (*ADMM*), as
described in Baek, Düker, and Pipiras (2023). However, neither of these
methods explicitly exploits the sparsity nature of the model, even
though the problem is defined in high-dimensional regimes. Our proposed
algorithm is designed to be highly efficient in sparse settings, which
has been compared to the benchmarks in terms of both estimation accuracy
and computational efficiency. The details can be found in Deb,
Kuceyeski, and Basu (2024).
