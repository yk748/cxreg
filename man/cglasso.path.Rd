\arguments{
\item{S}{p x p-dimensional symmetric spectral density (or spectral coherence) matrix. S is considered as being computed by average smoothed periodogram (the bandwidth is computed by using the given nobs).}

\item{D}{The p x p-dimensional diagonal matrix with spectral densities as the diagonal entries. Default is \code{NULL}. If D is not provided, diagonals of S are chosen.}

\item{type}{Logical flag to choose the formulation to solve. Default is \code{I}. If type is \code{I}, the algorithm solves CGLASSO-I in the reference,
\deqn{D^{-1/2}(\arg\min_{\Theta}Tr[\hat{R}\hat{\Theta}]-\log\det\Theta + \sum_{i\neq j}|\Theta_{ij}|)D^{-1/2}} for the given $D$. If type is \code{II}, the algorithm solves CGLASSO-II in the reference. It is for each iterative classo with covariate update, the scale matrix D is multiplied. Please see the reference for the details of the iterative updates.}

\item{nobs}{Number of observations used in computation of the spectral density matrix S. This quantity is need to compute the Fourier frequency, extended BIC, and bandwidth for the average smoothed periodogram.}

\item{lambda}{A user supplied \code{lambda} sequence.
Typical usage is to have the program compute its own \code{lambda} sequence based on
\code{nlambda} and \code{lambda.min.ratio}.
Supplying a value of \code{lambda} overrides this.
WARNING: use with care. Avoid supplying a single value for \code{lambda}}

\item{nlambda}{The number of \code{lambda} values - default is 50.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{Smallest value for \code{lambda}, as a fraction of
\code{lambda.max}, the (data derived) entry value (i.e. the smallest value
for which all coefficients are zero). The default depends on the sample size
\code{nobs} relative to the number of variables \code{nvar}.
If \code{nobs > p}, the default is \code{0.0001}, close to zero.
If \code{nobs < p}, the default is \code{0.01}.}

\item{W.init}{Logical flag whether the initially estimated spectral density matrix is given. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{stopping_rule}{Logical flag if the algorithm is terminated by stopping rule. If the algorithm is early terminated ,not all estimates for initially designated lambdas are explored.}

\item{stop_criterion}{Stopping criterion for early termination. Default is \code{EBIC} (Extended BIC). Alternatively, \code{AIC} (AIC) and \code{RMSE} (root mean squared error between two consecutive estimates) can be used.}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of iterations of both outer and inner loops. Default 500.}

\item{thresh}{Convergence threshold for coordinate descent. Default is 1e-4.}

\item{trace.it}{If \code{trace.it=1}, then a progress bar is displayed;
useful for big models that take a long time to fit.}
}
\value{
An object with class "cglassofit" and "cglasso".
\item{a0}{Intercept sequence of length \code{length(lambda)}.}
\item{beta}{A \code{nvar x length(lambda)} matrix of coefficients, stored in
sparse matrix format.}
\item{df}{The number of nonzero coefficients for each value of lambda.}
\item{dim}{Dimension of coefficient matrix.}
\item{lambda}{The actual sequence of lambda values used. When alpha=0, the
largest lambda reported does not quite give the zero coefficients reported
(lambda=inf would in principle). Instead, the largest lambda for alpha=0.001
is used, and the sequence of lambda values is derived from this.}
\item{dev}{The fraction of (null) deviance explained. The deviance
calculations incorporate weights if present in the model. The deviance is
defined to be 2*(loglike_sat - loglike), where loglike_sat is the log-likelihood
for the saturated model (a model with a free parameter per observation).
Hence dev=1-dev/nulldev.}
\item{nulldev}{Null deviance (per observation). This is defined to be
2*(loglike_sat -loglike(Null)). The null model refers to the intercept model.}
\item{npasses}{Total passes over the data summed over all lambda values.}
\item{jerr}{Error flag, for warnings and errors (largely for internal
debugging).}
\item{call}{The call that produced this object.}
\item{family}{Family used for the model.}
\item{nobs}{Number of observations.}

#' @return An object with class "cglassofit" and "cglasso".
\item{stop_arr}{Sequence of values of information criterion for a fixed lambda.}
\item{stop_criterion}{Stopping criterion used.}
\item{min_index}{The index for lambda that minimizes the value of the information criterion.}
\item{lambda_grid}{Sequence of lambdas used.}
\item{Theta_hat}{Estimated inverse spectral matrix for each fixed lambda. It is provided in the list.}
\item{type}{Type of the formulation used, either CGALSSO-I or CGLASSO-II.}
\item{scale}{Whether the spectral density matrix (covariance) or spectral coherence (coherence) is given.}
\item{D}{Used scale diagonal matrix.}
